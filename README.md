# Airbnb-Dashboard
🚀 Excited to share my latest Tableau Project – Airbnb Dashboard! I developed this interactive dashboard to analyze Airbnb listings, bookings, and revenue trends across zip codes and over time, providing actionable insights into pricing, occupancy, and high-performing areas. By interacting with filters and charts, users can quickly explore:

📊 Average price per bedroom across locations
📈 Revenue trends by year and zip code
📉 Price distribution and occupancy patterns
🔍 Top-performing zip codes and listings

This project allowed me to combine data analysis, visualization, and storytelling to uncover patterns in Airbnb performance while sharpening my Tableau and data handling skills.
